# 📊 Pandas Learning

This repository contains my learning journey with the Pandas library, covering everything from basic data handling to advanced data analysis techniques.  
The goal of this section is to gain practical skills in working with real-world datasets for Data Science and Machine Learning.

## 📁 Contents

- Day 1-2: Pandas Basics
  - Creating Series and DataFrames
  - Reading CSV, Excel, and JSON files
  - Basic attributes: head(), tail(), info(), describe()
  - Indexing and slicing

- Day 3-4: Data Cleaning
  - Handling missing values: isnull(), dropna(), fillna()
  - Detecting and removing duplicates
  - Correcting data types
  - Renaming columns
  - String operations

- Day 5-6: Data Manipulation
  - Filtering and conditional selection
  - Sorting: sort_values() and sort_index()
  - Aggregations with groupby()
  - Pivot tables
  - Merging and joining DataFrames
  - MultiIndex operations

- Day 7: Exporting and Real-World Examples
  - Exporting DataFrames to CSV, Excel, and JSON
  - Analyzing real-world datasets (e.g., sales data, automobile data)
  - Mini projects:
    1. Restaurant Sales Analysis
    2. Automobile Dataset Cleaning & Analysis
    3. Student Performance Report

## 📌 Skills Learned

By completing this section, I have learned to:
- Load and inspect datasets efficiently
